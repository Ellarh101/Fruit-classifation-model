🍎 Fruit Classification Using Deep Learning
This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning (MobileNetV2) to classify fruit images with high accuracy. It integrates data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation into a clean, reproducible pipeline.

✨ Key Features
End-to-end fruit classification with TensorFlow/Keras.
Transfer learning + custom CNN layers for optimized performance.
Robust data augmentation (rotation, shifting, zoom, flipping).
Visualizations of training accuracy and loss.
Easily adaptable to other image classification tasks.

🚀 Applications
Smart Agriculture: fruit grading, quality detection.
Retail Automation: self-checkout systems using computer vision.
Supply Chain: sorting and monitoring perishable goods.
